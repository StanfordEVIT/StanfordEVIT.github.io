# Stanford Escondido Village IT Infrastructure

## Website Infrastructure
We currently manage three domains:
1. https://ev.stanford.edu/
2. https://evgr.stanford.edu/
3. https://kennedy.stanford.edu/

All three are hosted via [Stanford Sites](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/stanfordsites).

### How to Manage Stanford Sites


### How to Manage Virtual Proxy Domain Names
In April 2021, Stanford switched from virtual hosts to virtual proxies, which involved a change of [organizational workgroups](https://workgroup.stanford.edu/main/WGApp). Stanford IT uses the workgroup "evhousing:evitcas"
to manage these virtual proxies.
* A tutorial on workgroups can be found [here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/workgroup/myworkgroups).
